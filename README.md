# 2024_Continental_Tournaments_Projections
This project predicts the results of UEFA Euro 2024 and the 2024 Copa America by simulating each tournament 10,000 times using an elo-based [Monte Carlo Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method). <br>

Each team's probabilities are based on updated games completed in the tournament, [Elo Ratings](http://www.eloratings.net/), and [SPI ratings](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-api/international/spi_global_rankings_intl.csv).

Updates are made after the completion of **ALL** matches on a particular day for the Group Stage and after the completion of all games for a particular Knockout Round.
